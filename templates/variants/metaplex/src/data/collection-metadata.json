    "description": "that one winter  \nthe street lights bled  \nwhat glow they had left  \ninto our hands  \ninstead of the night sky  \nand we'd feel the regret it held  \nand the relief in dying  \nor succumbing to the inevitable  \nand sometimes we'd cry  \nbecause it made us warm  \nfor the first time in years  \nand because there weren't many stars anymore  \nand the moon seemed in disrepair too  \nand in time  \nwe couldn't see each others faces anymore \neven though we hadn't in years anyway\n\nthough we felt the crevices that grew like tree roots  \nand thought about how we couldn't remember that story dad used to tell  \nand wondered if it was buried somewhere in one of the sagging fault lines  \nor the pool of flies \nwhose wings sometimes made it hard to see  \nbut didn't ever reach to find out\n\nbecause all we could think about was that street light  \nand the resentment it held  \nor if it held anything at all",
